# ORM
    - ORM stands for Object Relational Mapper. Here `Object refers to: Obejct Oriented Programming,`
    `Relational refers to: Relational Database( Like mysql)` and `Mapper refers to: Mapping of relational
    db syntax to an Object oriented syntax`

    ORM acts as a layer between the developer and the databases, and it helps us to visualise and 
    even code all the relation logic in the form of object oriented code. That means, every entity
    which becomes a table in relational database, can be treated as a blue print, and the entries of
    the tables can be treated as new object. So it establishes a relation between tables and objects.
```
    This concept is not only limited to NodeJs or Mysql, but other big frameworks like Ruby on Rails,
    Django etc by default support ORM. for our usecase i.e. for NodeJs we need to use a Third part
    ORM which is `Sequalize`.
```

    So in Order to setup a basic demo project
``` 
    npm init
    npm i express
    npm i sequelize mysql2
    npm i sequelize-cli

```
